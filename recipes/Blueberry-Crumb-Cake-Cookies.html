<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>4 ounces full fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <1i>1 1/4 cups fresh blueberries</1i>
</ul>
<h3>Coating:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Icing:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs, or as needed for garnish</li>
    <li>blueberries as needed for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets
        with silicone baking mats.</li>
    <li>Whisk together flour, 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs, baking soda, baking
        powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
    <li>Beat butter, cream cheese, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla
        extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high
        speed until lightened and fairly smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. There will still
        be some small chunks of cream cheese in the mixture, and that is okay. Beat
        in lemon zest and juice. Pour in half the flower mixture and mix until just
        combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined. Fold 
        in blueberries with a spatula.</li>
    <li>IN a shallow bowl or pie plate, stir together 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
        and 3 tablespoons white sugar. Drop an approximately 2 tablespoon-sized
        piece of cookie dough into graham cracker mixture, and coat with crumbs.
        Carefully roll dough into a ball, and roll again in crumbs. Carefully roll
        dough balls at least 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Repeat with
        remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies begin to turn golden, and no longer
        look wet on top, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 
        5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>To make icing, whisk together powdered sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice,
        1/4 teaspoon lemon zest, and salt until combined. Whisk in heavy cream. 
        Glaze each cookie with a scant tablespoon of icing, then add a sprinkle of
        graham cracker crumbs plus 3 blueberries on tob, if desired.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can make these cookies slightyly larger or smaller than the 2 tablespoon 
    size. Just adjust your baking time accordingly. The icing on top can be altered
    to suite your tastes - you can add more or less lemon zest/juice, or add more 
    powdered sugar, if you prefer</li> 
    <li>I made these cookies on both parchment papper-lined pans and Silpat-lined
        pans. The cookies on the parchment -lined pans spread more than the ones
        baked on the silicone baking mats. I highly recommend using Silpats if you
        can.</li>
